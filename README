There are several distinct codes.

nr/ : c code.  Instructions on how to build this in nr/README

pv/ : python code.  It is dependent on the lsst stack already installed
on cori.  This code is set up using

source /global/common/software/lsst/cori-haswell-gcc/stack/setup_current_sims.sh
setup lsst_sims

pv/dragan/ : c code.  Uses gsl.  According to cori instructions the following commands must be done

module load gsl
module swap PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu

compiled using make.  If successful creates the executable pv/dragan/sig

pv/CAMB/ : fortran code.  It is an external modules. it is build using make. If successful creates the executable pv/CAMB/sig.  This executable is called by sig so needs to be in the PATH.

The code that we would like to make faster is sig.  It reads the file pvlist.1234.dat.  There are two versions of this file.  In /global/homes/a/akim/desc/PeculiarVelocity/out there is the real one we want to use.  In /global/homes/a/akim/desc/PeculiarVelocity/test/ there is a short one that completes quickly.

1) Make the SNe and galaxies
> python PVHostGalaxies.py 

2) Make ASCII file readable by Dragan's code
In [1]: from HostGalaxies import *
In [2]: HostGalaxies().draganFormat() 

3) Run Dragan's code from directory where ascii file is created
>sig

4) Fit parameters
> python fit.py

5) Look at output
> python view.py

5) in the src dir, run:
gcc -c *.c -I ../opt/local/include 
   {the latter is where to look for include directory, e.g. /opt/local/include/recipes}
   (makes many .o files)

6) ar r librecipes.a *.o
   (archive, replace, name has t start with 'lib', end with 'a')

7) move librecipes.a into directory /lib

8) in ~/lib run  
ranlib librecipes.a
